# A-Review-on-Polycarbonate-Collector-for-Solar-Water-Heating-System
Heating water for domestic purpose is a simple and effective way of utilizing solar energy but initial cost of solar  water heating system is high. The conventional solar water heating technologies faces the major challenges of installation,  bulkiness and reliability, which acts as a bump in growth of the world wide solar market penetration. It is necessary to find some  reliable, cost effective material to bridge this gap through technology development. The Solar Water Heating System having  Polycarbonate sheet as a collector is studied by different researchers. The aim behind such performance evaluation is to find  new material for solar thermal collector and develops the feasible technology. This paper shows comprehensive review on polycarbonate solar water heater.
